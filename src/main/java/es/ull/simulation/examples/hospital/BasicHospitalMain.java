/**
 * Main class to execute the "hospital" tutorial example.
 * 
 * The "hospital" is simply a set of operating theatres and consultation rooms. 
 * Patients arrive at the hospital to be seen by a doctor. If the doctor decides so, a surgical team operates on the
 * patient. After the surgical intervention, the doctor assesses the result of the intervention.
 * In case the intervention failed, the surgical team reoperates on the patient, and further reassessments are
 * performed.
 * 
 * The hospital has 6 doctors (3 of them are also surgeons), and 3 nurses. Doctors and nurses work from 8:00 to 15:00. 
 * Surgical interventions are scheduled from 11:00 to 14:00.
 * 
 * 5% of the patients that attend to an appointment require surgery, independently of the previous history of
 * the patient.
 * 
 * Surgical teams require 2 surgeons and 1 nurse. In some cases, only 1 surgeon and 1 nurse may carry out the surgical 
 * intervention, but only by incrementing its duration.
